The application handles various scenarios such as successful payments, bad requests, unauthorized access, and server errors through mocked API responses.


# Features
- Payment Button: Initiates the payment process.
- Dialog Box: Collects payment details including 'To' (email address), 'From' (dropdown with options BTC and ETH), 'Amount' (positive numeric field), and an optional 'Description'.
